# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple terminal game of tic-tac-toe.  The first commit is very limited - there is virtually nothing done to handle user error, so there
are plenty of features that still need to be added.  

Start the game by running the file gamecontroller.rb in the terminal with

`ruby gamecontroller.rb`
