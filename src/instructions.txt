The rules are simple: 

A player will be randomly picked to go first.  The two players will
alternate picking spots to place their "marker", which will either
be an "X" (for the player who goes first) or an "O" (for the player
who goes second).  The goal is to be the first to get three of your
marker in a row on the board.  This can happen horizontally by
having all three columns of a particular row occupied by your
marker, vertically by having all three rows in a particular columns
occupied by your marker, or diagonally along one of the two diagonals
of the board.  

When the game indicates that it is your turn, enter the spot where you
would like to place your marker in the form of an ordered pair inside 
of parentheses.  The first number should be the row of the spot that
you would like to play, where the top row is row 1, and the bottom row
is row 3.  Then you should type a comma, a space (optional), and then 
the number corresponding to the column of that row where you would like
to place your marker.  The leftmost column is indicated by column 1, and
the rightmost column is indicated by column 3.  

To play against the computer, type "CPU" as the name of one of the
players.
